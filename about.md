# About Dan Yatzeck

First and foremost, I am a 4th-generation lifelong Town of Genesee resident, of a broader extended family of lifelong residents. The Yatzeck name has been active and present in the town for many years, and now I continue the tradition.

For the past two years, I spent considerable time as a homeschool dad, instructing my son through 8th and 9th grade. Through this endeavor we learned about American History and spent substantial time on civics, the U.S. Government, Federalism, and most importantly the fact that our government consists of ordinary citizens, self-governing, and serving with vigor. Over the course of this exercise, I was reminded that our local town government has the closest tangible impact to our actual lives, and participation in this shared effort is not only possible, but publicly desirable for those with good character.

I see myself as an agreeable and thoughtful man, wanting to do what is right. I dislike personal attacks and political games - government should be there to steward community assets and serve the public, not used as a weapon or for personal gain. In the face of contention, I appreciate decorum and respect, knowing people are generally reasonable and come at a situation in good faith. There is always common ground if one seeks it with diligence; communication and an open mind are key, making every effort to see the situation from the other perspective.

I have long felt that there is a place for someone like me in public service in some respect, and right now I see the need in this Town Supervisor role. I humbly ask for your vote.

Some additional personal points of interest:
- Married for 17 years, with three kids (16), (15), and (12).
- I am a regular church attendee, which guides my personal philosophy.
- My career has been focused on computer networking and internet systems as an engineer and architect. Post-secondary schooling was completed at WCTC (AAS) and Carroll University (BS). 
- My interest in computers began at Kettle Moraine Middle School, which led me to volunteer at Three Pillars in Dousman teaching residents about how to use the computer and send email to family members. This was a wonderful and memorable experience.
- I also was involved in creating the first Town of Genesee website over 25 years ago.
