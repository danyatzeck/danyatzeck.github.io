# Community Input
This page is dedicated to ideas brought to me by the Town of Genesee community. I intend to update this section with specific issues or improvement ideas generated by you, the residents. Feel free to email me your thoughts at dan@yatzeck.com.

### Ideas and Improvement Opportunities

#### Communications
- Include more board activity on quarterly newsletters.
- Summarize board, plan commission, and fire commission activity for easier consumption on the website (rather than having to comb through minutes)
- Include explicit supervisor/chairman voting record each time a vote is taken
- Chairman should communicate to the town a clear vision and plan of action

#### Parks
- Improve park play equipment to support young families

#### Public Works
- Clean up the main road in Genesee Depot, especially the areas surrounding the railroad tracks, to make it more bright
- Improve parking in Genesee Depot; it is dangerous when so many people park on the street and it backs up
