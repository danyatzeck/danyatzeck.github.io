# Fire Fee Considerations

We are dropping the ball on Fire Services. 
- No public notice that this is a problem.
- No Referendum on the books.
- No communication on options.

The Town of Genesee [authorized a $480,000 loan](https://towngenesee.wi.gov/sysfiles/site_uploads/pubs/pub58615_251113080045_1.pdf) to cover fire service fees over what was budgeted.

This is unacceptable. 

[Approved 4-0](https://towngenesee.wi.gov/sysfiles/site_uploads/pubs/pub58613_251113075856_1.pdf). Supervisor Morris was absent, though he is on the Fire Commission so may have abstained otherwise (also, why was he gone for such an important vote?).


#### What are Fire Fees?

The Town of Genesee utilizes Lake Country Fire and Rescue to provide fire services in conjunction with 6 other municipalities in the area. The total budget is split between these municipalities using a funding formula. It's not equal, but it's fair enough for this discussion.

The town pays our portion of the multi-municipality agreement out of the general fund as a simple budget line item, and it comes from normal property taxes.

A fire fee breaks this out as a separate "special fee", so it can be treated differently than a normal operating expense. The idea is to decouple fire services from the general fund, lower property taxes in proportion to what it otherwise would be, and spread it out among all recipients of the service versus only those that pay property taxes. This has a two-fold benefit: normal folks shouldn't see much increase in their total tax, and we have more leverage as a town to negotiate in the future.

#### How do other municipalities handle this?
There are two ways to handle this in a responsible way: a fire fee, or simply increasing taxes via referendum. Some simple research on other local municipalities indicates that most have chosen the fire fee route, while a couple others did tax increase.

#### To Fire Fee or to Not Fire Fee?
**Pro** argument:
- When the fire service funding comes from property taxes, only property owners are paying for the service, even though the services are available to all entities in the township (businesses, non-profits, etc.). Now everyone covered by the service will contribute to the overall payment. This is more fair.
- Because more people will be paying for the service, property taxes will go down in proportion to the amount of new contributors.
- We can't get out of paying for fire services - public safety is a core function of town government, and we must support full coverage.
- As a town, a fire fee is something the board can do to directly meet the immediate need.
- As shown above, it's pretty common.


**Con** argument:
- It looks and feels like a new tax. It isn't "technically" a tax, but it feels like it. The alternative to a fire fee is actually increasing taxes via referendum, so it's hard to see the practical difference.
- Nothing is preventing the town from increasing property taxes back to the original level once fire services are removed.
- Non-profits by definition spend their limited resources on their mission, and introducing town fees takes away from this service.
- Go to referendum instead - let the people decide whether to do a fire fee or increase property taxes to cover the service.


#### My position
Put out a referendum and phrase it just like [City of Delafield](https://www.cityofdelafieldwi.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6825/Fire-EMS-Referendum-Explanation-) did: **Vote Yes** to implement a fire fee, **Vote No** to accept sub-standard service, negotiate a lower rate using a different partner, or increase taxes.


My questions to the board about this:
- What leverage did we have in negotiating? Did we even try?
- Why was the public not informed of this in a more comprehensive manner? It seems like a referendum was possible but this was not done.
- We have seen other communities handle this for 3 years. This was foreseeable. Confront the issue guys, what's going on?
- Did we look at Western Lakes Fire District, Kettle Moraine Fire District, or Village of Waukesha to compete with LCFR?
- How or why was a loan considered?
